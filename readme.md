Create a webpage with four overlapping boxes (box1, box2, box3, box4), each slightly shifted to create a layered effect. The boxes should be positioned using absolute positioning, with z-index values to control the stacking order. Each box should have a width of 300px, a height of 200px, and different background colors.
