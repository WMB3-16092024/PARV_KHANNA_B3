Instructions:
You are tasked with creating a webpage that utilizes CSS selectors and properties to style various HTML elements, including an image. This assignment focuses on the correct use of IDs, classes, and element selectors to control the design of the webpage.

Requirements:
Create an HTML file with the following structure:

A div element with the ID container.
Two span elements inside the div, with one having the ID title1 and the other with the ID title2.
A p element inside the div with the class paragraph that contains some placeholder text.
An img element outside the div with the class hero-image-class that links to an image using the src attribute, provides an alt description, and uses the title attribute for a tooltip.
Apply the following CSS styles:

Set a border of 2px solid black and a background color of grey for the #container.
Define the width and height of the #container to 200px.
Set the text color of the .title1 class to black.
Set the text color of the #title2 ID to red.
Set the text color of the paragraph with the class .paragraph to white.
Define the width of the image with the class .hero-image-class to 600px and the height to 400px.
Your webpage should display:

The word "Web" in black and the word "Master" in red.
The text in the paragraph should be white and all the content should appear inside a 200px by 200px grey box with a black border.
The image below the box should be sized to 600px width and 400px height, with a tooltip appearing when hovered.
Deliverables:
Submit the HTML file and the CSS file.
Ensure your code is properly structured and formatted.
