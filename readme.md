You have the following HTML structure with a main container that holds four div elements, each styled with different linear gradients in CSS:

Modify the first div (.one) to create a radial gradient that transitions from a blue center to a light blue edge.
Change the second div (.two) to use a linear gradient that smoothly transitions from red at the top to yellow at the bottom with no hard stops.
Adjust the third div (.three) to create a diagonal linear gradient that starts from the top left corner and transitions from dark green to light green.
In the fourth div (.four), modify the current gradient to include an additional color transition, blending from purple to pink in between the existing color gradients.
