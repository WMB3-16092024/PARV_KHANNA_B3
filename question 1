Create 10 div elements using only HTML and CSS. Each div should have a unique width and height specified in one of the following units:

cm
in
px
em
ch
rem
vh
vw
vmin
vmax
Your task is to:

Create 10 div elements in the HTML.
Style each div with a different unit for both width and height in the CSS.
Give each div a unique background color to distinguish them from one another.
Optionally, add text inside each div to indicate which units are used for that divâ€™s width and height.
Write the HTML and CSS to achieve this.
